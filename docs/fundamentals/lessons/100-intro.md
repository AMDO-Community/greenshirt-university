## Purpose
Understand the maintenance system at a high level so you can lead it, not just react to it.

## Key points
- Maintenance is a system: people, process, parts, time, and risk.
- Readiness is driven by quality data and disciplined execution.
- Your job is to create clarity, priorities, and flow.

## Practical application
- Walk the spaces daily and learn the bottlenecks.
- Track top down aircraft/requirements daily, publish priorities.
- Fix one friction point each week (tools, parts, training, process).

## Common mistakes
- Confusing urgency with priority.
- Letting bad documentation become normal.

## Oral board prompts
- Explain how maintenance, supply, and QA interact to drive readiness.
- What metrics would you watch weekly, and why?

## References
- Add your governing instructions and command references here.
